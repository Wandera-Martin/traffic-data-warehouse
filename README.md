# Traffic Data Warehouse
## Overview
This project involves the development of a scalable data warehouse to support the city traffic department in optimizing traffic flow and enabling advanced urban planning initiatives. By leveraging swarm UAVs and static roadside cameras, we will collect comprehensive vehicle trajectory data. This data will be processed and stored in a data warehouse to provide actionable insights for the city traffic department.
## Business Need
The city traffic department seeks to improve traffic efficiency and inform future urban development projects. By analyzing real-time traffic data, the department aims to identify congestion hotspots, optimize traffic signal timings, and implement intelligent traffic management strategies.
